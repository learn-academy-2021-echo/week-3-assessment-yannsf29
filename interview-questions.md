# ASSESSMENT 3: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.


1. What is `this` in JavaScript?

  Your answer: 'the this' refers to an object/keyword in the class

  Researched answer:
  The JavaScript this keyword refers to the object it belongs to. It has different values depending on where it is used: In a method, this refers to the owner object. Alone, this refers to the global object.



2. What is React? Why would you use it?

  Researched answer:
  React. js is an open-source JavaScript library that is used for building user interfaces specifically for single-page applications. ... React allows developers to create large web applications that can change data, without reloading the page. The main purpose of React is to be fast, scalable, and simple.

  It's used for handling the view layer for web and mobile apps. React also allows us to create reusable UI components. ... React allows developers to create large web applications that can change data, without reloading the page. The main purpose of React is to be fast, scalable, and simple.



3. Which lifecycle method is required in a React class component?

  Your answer: The constructor and the render method is a required method in a class component.

  Researched answer: render() The render() method is the only required method in a class component.


Each component in React has a lifecycle which you can monitor and manipulate during its three main phases. The three phases are: Mounting, Updating, and Unmounting.



4. What is JSX? What is one notable difference between HTML and JSX?

  Your answer: jsx is a text language that translate into HTML

  Researched answer:
  JSX is an inline markup that looks like HTML and gets transformed to JavaScript. A JSX expression starts with an HTML-like open tag, and ends with the corresponding closing tag. JSX tags support the XML self close syntax so you can optionally leave the closing tag off.

  Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard language for documents that determine the structure of a web page. Your code is either in HTML originally or compiles to it so browsers can read it. ... JSX, on the other hand, means JavaScript Syntax Extension or JavaScript XML as some like to put it.


5. What is yarn? What file(s) are modified in a React application when you run yarn?

  Your answer: Yarn is a package manager for my code.

  Researched answer:
Yarn is a package manager for your code. It allows you to use and share (e.g. JavaScript) code with other developers from around the world. Yarn does this quickly, securely, and reliably so you don't ever have to worry.


Type yarn start, this will make a build folder within the root folder. Stop that operation (on a mac it's ctrl-c) and then build the updated version. it is clear that your yarn start command is building your application

  Your answer: it is a function that is not declared

  Researched answer:

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

1. Conditional rendering:
Conditional rendering is a term to describe the ability to render different user interface (UI) markup if a condition is true or false. In React, it allows us to render different elements or components based on a condition.

2. Props: React allows us to pass information to a Component using something called props (stands for properties). Props are basically kind of global variable or object.

3. JavaScript Events:
HTML events are "things" that happen to HTML elements.

When JavaScript is used in HTML pages, JavaScript can "react" on these events.
An HTML event can be something the browser does, or something a user does.

Here are some examples of HTML events:

An HTML web page has finished loading
An HTML input field was changed
An HTML button was clicked
Often, when events happen, you may want to do something.

JavaScript lets you execute code when events are detected.

HTML allows event handler attributes, with JavaScript code, to be added to HTML elements.



4. Object-oriented programming:

Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a computer programming model that organizes software design around data, or objects, rather than functions and logic. An object can be defined as a data field that has unique attributes and behavior. ... Each distinct logic sequence is known as a method.

5. Ruby:

Ruby is most used for building web applications. However, it is a general-purpose language similar to Python, so it has many other applications like data analysis, prototyping, and proof of concepts. Probably the most obvious implementation of Ruby is Rails web, the development framework built with Ruby.
